# E-commerce Back End

## Built with 
 * Javascript
 * Sequelize


## Description/Purpose
* Challenge for UW Extensions Coding Bootcamp. 
* Functionality: This is a mock-back end for an e-commerce site. User should add their MySQL username and password to the .env file and will be able to connect to a database using Sequelize. User can start server using "npm start", and then use the Get, Post, Put, and Delete routes in Insomnia to show/create/edit/delete the different categories, products and tags on the site.

## User Story 
* GIVEN a functional Express.js API
* WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
* THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
* WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
* THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
* WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
* THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
* WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
* THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
* WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
* THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
